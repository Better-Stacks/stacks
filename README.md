## Coming soon: [Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing Platform](https://betterstacks.com)

Stacks is a self-managed shared repository of links for teams. It is an automated bookmarking service and a noise-free collaboration platform for teams. It provides an easy and pleasant search of your saved content and favorites. With Stacks, teams can access their shared links quickly and easily, without the clutter and confusion of searching through emails and messages.

Stacks is your home base for everything youâ€™ve saved including places you want to visit, restaurants you want to recommend to your colleagues, links to internal documents, research for your customers, and anything and everything you find online and valuable for your team to know about. If you are new to Stacks, you can import bookmarks and saved links into your Stacks home or add them manually. Or with the browser extension, you can bookmark links to your Stacks home just as you would bookmark them in the browser. All saved links are personal until you decide to share them with the teams. 

By curating your links into Stacks, you can store them easily and securely, while still having the ability to share them with colleagues and friends.
